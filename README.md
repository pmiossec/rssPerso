## Roadmap

* Reading list:
    - order by date / feed
    - download before saving reading list (to prevent loosing links)
<!-- * Refactoring:
    - archive list in another gist -->
* Being able to add to Pocket or Wallabag (from ToDoList or from rss feed)
* Display icon of all feeds on top (toggle show all/none)
